# Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

## Security Concepts

1. CIA Triad
    - Confidentiality: measure used to ensure the protection of the secrecy of data, objects or resources. The goal is to preveint or minimise unauthorized access to data.
      - Sensitivity: quality of informatio, which could hard or damage if disclosed.
      - Discretion: is an act of decision where an operator can influence or control disclosure in order to minimise hard or damage
      - Criticality: the level to which information is mission cirtical is its measure of criticality.
      - Concealment: is the act of hiding or preventing disclosure.
      - Secrecy: is the act of keeping something a secret.
      - Privacy: refer to keeping information confidential that is personally identifiable or that might cause harm if revealed.
      - Seclusion: involves storing something in an out-of-the-way localtion with strict access controls.
      - isolation: is the act of keeping something separate from others.
    - Integrity: is the concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data.
    - Availability: means authorised subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects.
2. Authenticity: security concept that data is authentic and originates from its alleged source.
3. Nonrepudiation: ensure that subject of an activity or who caused an event cannot deny that the event occurred.
4. AAA: Authentication, authorisation, accounting
    - Identification: is claiming to be an identity when attempting to access a secured area or system.
    - Authentication: is proving that you are that claimed identity.
    - Authorisation: is defining the permission of a resource and object access for a speciric identity or subject.
    - Auditing: is recoding a log of the events and activities related to the system and subjects.
    - Accounting: is reviewing log files to check for compliance and violations in order to hold subjects accountable for their actions
5. Defense in Depth: layering, is the use of multiple controls in a series
6. Encryption: is the science of hiding the meaning or intent of a communication from unintended recipients

## Security Governance

1. Security Governance: is the collection of practices related to supporting, evaluating, defining and directing the security efforts of an organisation. Optimally, security governance is performed by a board of directors

[*] the best security plan is useless without one key factor: approval by senior management.

## Organisational Roles and Responsibility

1. Senior Manager: role is assigned to the person who is ultimately responsible for the security maintained by an organisation and who should be most concerned about the protection of its assets.
2. Security Professional: is responsible for following the directives mandated by senior management
3. Asset Owner: is responsible classifying information for placement and protection
4. Custodian: is reponsible for the tasks of implementing the prescribed protection defined by the security policy and senior management.
5. User: is assigned to any person who has access to the secured system
6. Auditor: is responsible for reviewing and verifying that the security policy is properly implemented and the derived security solutions are adequate
7. Security Leader: serves as the subject matter expert on issues of CIA
8. Business Leader: Understands the mission, goals, objectives of the broader organisation

## Due Deligence and Due Care

Due care: security professional must fulfilling legal responsibilities and professional best practices - doing right action at the right time
Due diligence: security professional must take reasonable measures to investigate security risk - knowing what should be done and planning for it

## Security Control Frameworks

1. COBIT - Control Objectives for IT - business focus control framework
2. ISO 27001 - cybersecurity control objectives
3. ISO 27002 - cybersecurity control implementation
4. ISO 27701 - privacy controls
5. ISO 31000 - risk management programs
6. NIST 800-53 - mandatory for federal agencies
7. NIST Cybersecurity Framework

PII - Personally Identifiable Information - any information that can be traced back to an individual
PHI - Protected Health Information - Individually identifiable health records governed under HIPAA

## GAPP - Generally Accepted Privacy Principles

1. Management
2. Notice
3. Choice and Consent
4. Collection
5. Use, Retention and Disposal
6. Access
7. Disclosure to third parties
8. Security
9. Quality
10. Monitoring and Enforcement

## Data breach Consequences

1. Reputation damange
2. Identify theft
3. Fines
4. Intellectual property theft

## Security Policy, Standards, Procedures and Guidelines

1. Security policy - top tier, document that defines the scope of security needed by the organisation and discusses the assets that require protection. Overview or generalisation of an organisation's security needs

     - acceptable use policy - aup - define level of acceptable performance and expectation of behaviour and activity

2. Security standards - define compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology and security controls
    - Security beseline - define minimum level of security that every system throughout the organisation must meet
    - Guideline - offer recommendations on how standards and baselines are implemented

3. Security Procedures - is a detailed, step-by-step how-to document that describes the exact actions necessary to implement a specific security mechanism, control or solution.
